        '''Chado (The way of Tea) is a Japanese cultural practice involving  the preparation and serving of Matcha to a guest, primarily influenced  by the Zen Buddhism and it is based around 4 core principles: Harmony, Respect, Purity and Tranquility (Wa, Kei, Sei and Jaku). By practicing Chado, the aim is to experience and integrate these principles into one's daily life.

Wa (和) or “harmony”  embodies the feeling of oneness with nature and people. It is expressed  through a positive interaction between host and guest, guest and guest,  and more in general between man and nature. It extends outside of the  tea room through a way of living that is free from desire to impress,  compete and dominate, enabling a merging and transcending of individual  egos and roles. 

Kei (敬) or "respect" is the  ability to understand and accept others, even in those situations when  one does not agree with another. By being kind and humble towards others  we give respect and encourage others to do the same. Respect is also  extended towards utensils and objects, as a result not only of the human  effort invested to produce them, but also to the simple fact that they  came to existence through Nature. ''',
