    description:
        '''The samurai, members of a powerful military caste in feudal Japan, began as provincial warriors before rising to power in the 12th century with the beginning of the country’s first military dictatorship, known as the shogunate. As servants of the daimyos, or great lords, the samurai backed up the authority of the shogun and gave him power over the mikado (emperor). The samurai would dominate Japanese government and society until the Meiji Restoration of 1868 led to the abolition of the feudal system. Despite being deprived of their traditional privileges, many of the samurai would enter the elite ranks of politics and industry in modern Japan. More importantly, the traditional samurai code of honor, discipline and morality known as bushido–or “the way of the warrior”–was revived and made the basic code of conduct for much of Japanese society.

Early Samurai

During the Heian Period (794-1185), the samurai were the armed supporters of wealthy landowners–many of whom left the imperial court to seek their own fortunes after being shut out of power by the powerful Fujiwara clan. The word “samurai” roughly translates to “those who serve.” (Another, more general word for a warrior is “bushi,” from which bushido is derived; this word lacks the connotations of service to a master.)
Did you know? The wealth of a samurai in feudal Japan was measured in terms of koku; one koku, supposed to be the amount of rice it took to feed one man for a year, was equivalent to around 180 liters.
Beginning in the mid-12th century, real political power in Japan shifted gradually away from the emperor and his nobles in Kyoto to the heads of the clans on their large estates in the country. The Gempei War (1180-1185) pitted two of these great clans–the dominant Taira and the Minamoto–against each other in a struggle for control of the Japanese state. The war ended when one of the most famous samurai heroes in Japanese history, Minamoto Yoshitsune, led his clan to victory against the Taira near the village of Dan-no-ura.

Rise of the Samurai & Kamakura Period

The triumphant leader Minamoto Yoritomo–half-brother of Yoshitsune, whom he drove into exile–established the center of government at Kamakura. The establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate, a hereditary military dictatorship, shifted all real political power in Japan to the samurai. As Yoritomo’s authority depended on their strength, he went to great lengths to establish and define the samurai’s privileged status; no one could call himself a samurai without Yoritomo’s permission.
Zen Buddhism, introduced into Japan from China around this time, held a great appeal for many samurai. Its austere and simple rituals, as well as the belief that salvation would come from within, provided an ideal philosophical background for the samurai’s own code of behavior. Also during the Kamakura period, the sword came to have a great significance in samurai culture. A man’s honor was said to reside in his sword, and the craftsmanship of swords–including carefully hammered blades, gold and silver inlay and sharkskin handgrips–became an art in itself.

Japan in Chaos: the Ashikaga Shogunate

The strain of defeating two Mongol invasions at the end of the 13th century weakened the Kamakura Shogunate, which fell to a rebellion led by Ashikaga Takauji. The Ashikaga Shogunate, centered in Kyoto, began around 1336. For the next two centuries, Japan was in a near-constant state of conflict between its feuding territorial clans. After the particularly divisive Onin War of 1467-77, the Ashikaga shoguns ceased to be effective, and feudal Japan lacked a strong central authority; local lords and their samurai stepped in to a greater extent to maintain law and order.
Despite the political unrest, this period–known as the Muromachi after the district of that name in Kyoto–saw considerable economic expansion in Japan. It was also a golden age for Japanese art, as the samurai culture came under the growing influence of Zen Buddhism. In addition to such now-famous Japanese art forms as the tea ceremony, rock gardens and flower arranging, theater and painting also flourished during the Muromachi period.

Samurai under the Tokugawa Shogunate

The Sengoku-Jidai, or Period of the Country at War finally ended in 1615 with the unification of Japan under Tokugawa Ieyasu. This period ushered in a 250-year-long stretch of peace and prosperity in Japan, and for the first time the samurai took on the responsibility of governing through civil means rather than through military force. Ieyasu issued the “ordinances for the Military Houses,” by which samurai were told to train equally in arms and “polite” learning according to the principles of Confucianism. This relatively conservative faith, with its emphasis on loyalty and duty, eclipsed Buddhism during the Tokugawa period as the dominant religion of the samurai. It was during this period that the principles of bushido emerged as a general code of conduct for Japanese people in general. Though bushido varied under the influences of Buddhist and Confucian thought, its warrior spirit remained constant, including an emphasis on military skills and fearlessness in the face of an enemy. Bushido also emphasized frugality, kindness, honesty and care for one’s family members, particularly one’s elders.
In a peaceful Japan, many samurai were forced to become bureaucrats or take up some type of trade, even as they preserved their conception of themselves as fighting men. In 1588, the right to carry swords was restricted only to samurai, which created an even greater separation between them and the farmer-peasant class. The samurai during this period became the “two-sword man,” wearing both a short and a long sword as a mark of his privilege. The material well-being of many samurai actually declined during the Tokugawa Shogunate, however. Samurai had traditionally made their living on a fixed stipend from landowners; as these stipends declined, many lower-level samurai were frustrated by their inability to improve their situation.

Meiji Restoration & the End of Feudalism

In the mid-19th century, the stability of the Tokugawa regime was undermined by a combination of factors, including peasant unrest due to famine and poverty. The incursion of Western powers into Japan–and especially the arrival in 1853 of Commodore Matthew C. Perry of the U.S. Navy, on a mission to get Japan to open its doors to international trade–proved to be the final straw. In 1858, Japan signed a commercial treaty with the United States, followed by similar ones with Russia, Britain, France and Holland. The controversial decision to open the country to Western commerce and investment helped encourage resistance to the shogunate among conservative forces in Japan, including many samurai, who began calling for a restoration of the power of the emperor.
The powerful clans of Choshu and Satsuma combined efforts to topple the Tokugawa Shogunate and announce an “imperial restoration” named for Emperor Meiji in early 1868. Feudalism was officially abolished in 1871; five years later, the wearing of swords was forbidden to anyone except members of the national armed forces, and all samurai stipends were converted into government bonds, often at significant financial loss. The new Japanese national army quashed several samurai rebellions during the 1870s, while some disgruntled samurai joined secret, ultra-nationalist societies, among them the notorious Black Dragon Society, whose object was to incite trouble in China so that the Japanese army would have an excuse to invade and preserve order.
Ironically–given the loss of their privileged status–the Meiji Restoration was actually engineered by members of the samurai class itself. Three of the most influential leaders of the new Japan–Inoue Kaoru, Ito Hirobumi and Yamagata Aritomo–had studied with the famous samurai Yoshida Shouin, who was executed after a failed attempt to kill a Tokugawa official in 1859. It was former samurai who put Japan on the road to what it would become, and many would become leaders in all areas of modern Japanese society.

Bushido in Modern Japan

In the wake of the Meiji Restoration, Shinto was made the state religion of Japan (unlike Confucianism, Buddhism and Christianity, it was wholly Japanese) and bushido was adopted as its ruling moral code. By 1912, Japan had succeeded in building up its military strength–it signed an alliance with Britain in 1902 and defeated the Russians in Manchuria two years later–as well as its economy. By the end of World War I, the country was recognized as one of the “Big Five” powers alongside Britain, the U.S., France and Italy at the Versailles peace conference.
The liberal, cosmopolitan 1920s gave way to a revival of Japan’s military traditions in the 1930s, leading directly to imperial aggression and Japan’s entrance into World War II. During that conflict, Japanese soldiers brought antique samurai swords into battle and made suicidal “banzai” attacks according to the bushido principle of death before dishonor or defeat. At war’s end, Japan again drew on its strong sense of honor, discipline and devotion to a common cause—not the daimyos or shoguns of the past, but the emperor and the country—in order to rebuild itself and reemerge as one of the world’s greatest economic and industrial powers in the latter 20th century.

    description:
        '''Haiku is a Japanese form of short poetry. Born in the sixteenth century, it was popularized by poets Matsuo Basho, Yosa Buson, Kobayashi Issa, and Masaoki Shiki. Consisting of three short lines of often broken phrases, this Japanese art-form aims to share images, moments, and experiences with readers in order to move and inspire them, like this famous poem:

old pond:
frog jumps in,
the sound of water
Mastuo Basho

The fundamental problem with writing haiku is the idea that writing three short lines is easy. This idea couldn't be further from the truth. Haiku, though simple in its appearance, is a delicate art-form, and like all simple art-forms, it can be very difficult to tell whether one has created a strong, engaging, and memorable haiku piece.

In my studies and experience, I've come across five fundamental rules for writing haiku. These rules are at play in almost every well-crafted haiku poem. Of course, like all rules, these five are made to be broken. However, it is important to understand what the rules are and how and why they work before you consider violating them.

Rule 1: Focus on a single, brief moment, event, or experience
All well-crafted haiku focus on a brief, yet unique experience. They do not connect experiences or events as you would a story, but rather they take a single moment and attempt to share it. This is known as The Principle of Singularity. The point of haiku is not to go in-detail about a thought or relationship or experience. It’s simply to give something to share, as if to say, “Look at this!”

When writing haiku, focus on one single, special, emotive experience or event. Focus on a moment that you feel you have to share with another person. Perhaps this moment taught you a valuable lesson, or perhaps it awoke something dormant in you. Nevertheless, it should be a single, short, yet memorable experience that you feel compelled to share with your reader.

Rule 2: Make your haiku as realistic and clear as possible
Unlike most poetry, most haiku do not make direct use of metaphors, similes, hyperboles, or other rhetorical techniques. Nor does it make use of opinions. This is known as The Principle of Accuracy. According to this principle, descriptions in haiku should be as realistic, clear, and depictive as possible.

When writing haiku, focus on first describing what is going on in the experience. Do not focus on your feelings, opinions, or thoughts on the matter. Instead, concentrate only on what you can hear, see, smell, touch, or taste. Haiku requires solid, concrete images. In other words, show, don’t tell.

Rule 3: Use easy-to-understand words and images
The aim of a haiku poem is to share an image with another person in such a way that they can experience the event you’ve experienced in their own minds. To do this, the image you present must not only be clear, but relatable. This idea is known as The Principle of Accessibility.

According to this principle, a haiku poem must utilize words and concepts that gives the reader a context under which he or she can quickly understand the scene of the poem. In old times, for example, haiku poets would use season-words (kigo) that either directly mentions or alludes to a specific season. By doing this, they allow the reader to easily imagine the scene, since most readers are familiar with the different seasons.

When writing haiku, focus on providing images that the reader can easily grasp. If you make your images too esoteric, then the reader has a harder time feeling the emotion of the piece.

Rule 4: Organize strongest details in the most natural or effective order
Haiku is a practice in minimalism. The idea is to organize details in the simplest or most natural order. This is called The Principle of Economy. According to this principle, all details that do not strongly contribute to creating the image (this includes grammatical constructions like adjectives, adverbs, verbs) must be taken out from the description.

The point of economy isn't simply to keep the poem short, but to make sure that the details included in the poem are organized to create the most impact on the reader.

Rule 5: Make your haiku sayable in one breath
All haiku must be sayable in one breath. This is called The Principle of Brevity. According to this principle, if a haiku takes longer than a breath to say, then the poem loses its emotive force.

Traditionally, haiku poets would write haiku with 5 onji (or phonetic sounds) on the first line, 7 on the second, and 5 again on the third. Such a structure was consistent with the speaking rhythm in the Japanese language.

In the English world, we do not follow the same rhythm. Thus, we must stick with the principle of brevity and keep the haiku sayable in one breath. This makes the image easy to absorb and imagine for the reader. This principle works hand in hand with the principle of economy. In cutting out the unnecessary words, you must select words that allow the poem to flow in one breath.

    description: '''What is Zen?

The word “Zen” is tossed around so carelessly in the commercial world, the human potential world, the world of design, and in popular culture in general, that for someone new to it as an authentic spiritual tradition, it has become too vague to have much meaning. Real Zen is the practice of coming back to the actual right-now-in-this-moment self, coming back to the naturalness, the intimacy and simplicity of our true nature. Zen practice is not about getting away from our life as it is; it is about getting into our life as it is, with all of its vividness, beauty, hardship, joy, and sorrow. Zen is a path of awakening: awakening to who we really are, and awakening the aspiration to serve others and take responsibility for all of life.

This sounds good, but how is it to be accomplished? How is it possible to enter such a new way of experiencing one’s life?

The Practice

There is a term in the Celtic tradition that I find resonates with something fundamental about Zen practice. The Celts spoke of “thin places,” places like caves or wells or other special sites where the boundary between the mundane and magical was permeable. To me, Zen practice offers a kind of thin place, a “place” where we can discover that there is fundamentally no separation between ourselves and others, that what we seek is always so close, always right here. In the Lotus Sutra’s parable of the burning house, the only escape from our greed, anger, and ignorance is said to be through a “narrow door.” The narrow door, the thin place, and any of a number of metaphors point us in the direction of our own realization. A door or a gate or a threshold also implies that there is effort, movement, investment in transformation.

At the heart of Zen practice is zazen, seated meditation. One master said that listening and thinking are like being outside the gate, and zazen is returning home and sitting in peace. Zazen is really a very simple practice and does not involve complicated instructions. When one studies the ancient Zen meditation manuals, it is always surprising how brief and plain they are. While they speak of the possibility of attaining the freedom and naturalness of a tiger in the mountains or a dragon in the water, the actual instructions are so concrete. Sit in the proper posture and attend to the body, breath, and mind.

Make a Place to Sit

It is best to have a place set aside for regular zazen. Whether it is a room or just a corner, the space should be clean and uncluttered. Place a mat on the floor (a folded blanket will do) and on it a zafu, another type of comfortable sitting cushion, or a bench. If floor sitting is too difficult, simply use a chair.

Preparing to Sit

When you do zazen, wear loose, clean clothes. At the beginning of a sitting period, it is traditional to bow to an altar, offer a stick of incense, and bow once more. Then, as you stand before your seat, bow toward and away from your cushion, bench, or chair. These acts help us to realize intention and respect. The incense is offered with the intention that this session is for all beings, for all creation, not just for oneself. The standing bow to and away from our cushion actualizes our respect for our practice and for those, whether present or not, who practice with us. The physical act of bowing, of folding our body down, placing our head in a traditionally respectful position of vulnerability, gives the ego a big break, an opportunity to let go. When you are seated—whether cross-legged, kneeling, or in a chair—settle into the zazen posture: Place your hands on your lap or thighs, in the cosmic mudra, your right hand holding your left one, palms up, with your thumbs barely touching, forming a circle.

Posture

Your posture in sitting is vitally important. Sit on the forward third of your cushion or chair, so that your hips are higher than your knees and your belly is free to move in and out without stress on your lower back. Your ears are in line with your shoulders, your head balanced gently on your neck, your eyes are slightly open, gazing down about three feet in front of you. Your chin is pointing neither up nor down, but is slightly tucked in. Place your tongue just behind your teeth on the roof of your mouth. Sway from side to side until you find your center point.

The Breath

Now attend to the breath. Breathe naturally. Breathing in, allow the breath to fully enter your body until your lower belly expands; then, breathing out, softly allow the breath to ease out through your nostrils. Notice how the breath seems to travel through the main avenues of your torso. Your belly should rise and fall naturally with each breath. Let the breath fill your lower abdomen as if it were a balloon. Later, you may notice that even the bottoms of your feet are breathing in and out. As you relax into the breath, you can begin silently counting each full cycle of breath, noting “one” on the out-breath, “two” on the next out-breath, and so on up to “ten.” When you reach “ten,” begin again with “one.” When you realize that you have stopped counting, and are caught up in thinking, simply take another breath and go back to “one.”

Do this—counting your breath, maintaining your posture, sitting still—for the 20-minute period of zazen. Notice that urges to move—to scratch your nose, to tug on your ear—are usually ways to move away from the energies in your body. Instead of moving, stay with them, observe them, and bring your focus back to the breathing. Learn to notice how these urges fall away, only to be replaced by others, demonstrating the second noble truth: the cause of suffering is craving. All the disparate ideas, thoughts, impulses—everything comes and goes, and yet you sit. And little by little, the chatter drops away and your body, breath, and mind are one. Zazen is so simple. We focus on our posture and on counting our breath, and this develops samadhi, a unified mind. But the practice is not about reaching “ten.” It is about training the body and mind. Let the body settle, let the breath settle, let the mind settle. Don’t worry about whether your practice is working, don’t judge your performance, don’t tell yourself stories or find other ways to avoid this very moment. These are just ways of separating from our deepest intention and our zazen. When you do zazen, just do zazen. That’s enough.

The Original Self

In the Genjokoan (Actualizing the Fundamental Point), Zen Master Dogen writes:

When one first seeks the dharma, one is far away
from its environs.

When one has already correctly transmitted
the dharma to oneself, one is one’s original
self at that moment.

Dogen Zenji’s teaching reminds us of our initial separation from what is ours. When we begin to seek the dharma, there is an “I” that looks for it over “there.” But the dharma is already alive in us, and requires only that we realize it, which is what he means in the second sentence: having “correctly transmitted the dharma to oneself,” one is one’s real self in that moment.

I think all of us yearn to experience ourselves as whole and complete, to live our lives fully and freshly in each moment. But something blocks us, and Zen training is one way to see that, all along, we have what we need. This is called the realization of the original self.

The Daily Practice: Be Consistent

The zazen period we are recommending is 20 minutes. You may find that you will want to do more—or less— and that is fine. What is important is consistency. To keep your practice consistent, remember what the famous Nike ad says: “Just do it.” Don’t concern yourself with trying to get to some particular place or state of mind. Each day’s zazen will be a little different, just like the rest of life. We practice steadiness in our daily meditation—alert, sleepy, focused—we just practice each day, through the high points and the low. When you mess up—and you will— just say, “Okay, back to my cushion.” When you are sitting, you may realize that you are thinking about something else. At that moment, take a deep breath and recognize that, in that moment of realization, you have come back to now. As an old meditation manual says, as soon as you are aware of a thought, it will vanish! When we are thinking of a thing, we are lost in it, lost in thinking about “x.” But when we become aware of our thinking, then we are in a secondary state. The actual thinking of “x” is gone, and there is either just awareness or we begin a new thought based on that awareness. Either way, the original thinking is gone. If we practice daily, soon we are able to stay more often in that space of pure awareness without an object. Just breathing, just being present—we call this being naturally unified.

Zazen is a form that allows us to practice the no form of boundless emptiness. The freedom that is made available to us through form is one of those grand paradoxes of life. When we organize ourselves and create a structure, we also create the means to be free of structure. Form helps us by organizing and directing our energies. But we can carry our form lightly, with respect and appreciation for its gifts. This subtle discipline—settling, unifying, letting be—is called the dharma gate of peace and joy.

In addition to zazen and bowing, there are other aspects of Zen practice that help us on the way. One is setting up a home altar, which encourages the actualizing of respect and devotion. To place something on an altar is to meet it, to hold it in esteem. Traditionally, in Zen monasteries, the altar in the zendo (meditation hall) had as its focus a statue of Manjushri, the bodhisattva representing transcendent wisdom. Manjushri holds a sword that cuts away delusions, thus clearing our minds. By putting such an image on our altar, we vow to take on that strong energy of slicing away at our delusions, our ignorance, our greed and anger. We vow to be clear. For your home altar, place a statue or image of any buddha or bodhisattva who evokes in you the aspiration to realize those qualities— wisdom, compassion, peace—that he or she embodies. You may place an incense bowl and incense (which is a fine way to time your zazen); a flower, which evokes transient beauty; water, an element of nourishment; and a candle to brighten the space.

Related: Give Yourself a Breathing Room 

Study is another aspect of Zen. We study to encourage, refine, and deepen our own practice and that of others. This ango—the traditional 90-day Zen practice period—we will study Zen Master Dogen’s Genjokoan. How do we approach this or any other Zen study text? How do we penetrate the surface to get to the heart of the matter, to the workings of enlightened mind in the midst of daily life? Study the text as if it were a koan (a paradoxical phrase pointing to the nature of ultimate reality): chew on a few lines each day. And with each reading, stop and put the meaning into your life, asking yourself what this line means to you. In studying this inspiring and brilliant work, you can bring it directly into your own life, your own practice, so that the text comes to actually be yours and you express the text in your life. This is Zen study, and the Genjokoan will be the subject of my accompanying talks online.

The Precepts 

Finally, because all of this practice leads to our realization of our interdependence and interrelatedness with all beings, we will also take up the practice of the sixteen bodhisattva precepts. These precepts are not commandments; rather, they are guiding principles for living a life of freedom and service. The precepts will be one of the topics in the online discussions. The precepts are themselves worthy of a lifetime of study and practice. Indeed, in some Zen traditions, they are part of formal koan study, with each precept appreciated from various perspectives. Make them your own, be intimate with them. Rather than simply trying to follow them, embody them, in much the same way in which you “become” your zazen.

Sitting with Others

I encourage you to step up and experience Zen practice. But for now there is one more thing to keep in mind. While we are trying, both in this section and through the online resources, to provide you with what you need to get a solid start in establishing your own daily practice, Zen is not a solitary practice. As we chant at the end of our liturgy, “May we realize the Buddha Way together.” Sitting with others, studying with others, working with others, talking with others—all these are integral to the life of Zen. So I encourage you as well to join with others whenever possible. Go to a Zen meditation center or a similar group and sit with other people. And participate in our online community as well, where you will find a directory of Zen centers and teachers. Listen to the lectures, join the discussion group, read the supplemental material that will be posted. I hope that for the next three months you will help me in my own practice by joining this ango.''',

    description: '''
Historically, Japanese archery has been shrouded in myth and legend, making it difficult to assemble a completely accurate account of its development. Still, by focusing on the similarities recorded in ancient  chronicles, historians have managed to piece together a reliable picture of the historical development of kyudo. For clarity we have divided that development into five historical stages: Prehistoric (7,000 B.C to A.D.  330), Ancient (330-1192), Feudal (1192-1603), Transitional (1603-1912), and Modern (1912 to the present).
        	
The Prehistoric Period

It goes without saying that the evolution of Japanese archery closely coincides with the development and use of the Japanese bow. The earliest known inhabitants of the Japanese islands, a hunter-gatherer culture known as the Jomon relied heavily on the use of the bow. Their bows were of different lengths but most were the short, center-gripped type common to other primitive cultures. The Jomon bow was primarily used as a hunting tool but it is quite probable that it was also used in tribal warfare and ritual. From around 250 B.C to A.D. 330 the Yayoi culture flourished. During this time the bow came to be used as a symbol of political power. Legend says that Japan's first ruler was Emperor Jimmu, (illustration at right) who ascended to the thone in 660 B.C. And while many historians dispute this, the fact remains that in paintings and descriptions of his life Jimmu is always depicted holding a long bow, a symbol of his authority. A bronze casting from the Yayoi period appears to show the use of a long asymmetrical bow. And a written account compiled by the Chinese in the  third century describes the Japanese as using a bow with upper and lower limbs of differing length, so it is highly likely that the unique asymmetrical design of the Japanese bow was adopted during the Yayoi  period.

The Ancient Period

During this period Japan was strongly influenced by Chinese culture. It was then that ceremonial archery became an important part of the court system. The Japanese bowmakers also began to borrow the composite construction used by the Chinese, and by the tenth century had developed a two-piece composite bow using bamboo and wood. The Ancient period also saw the rise of the samurai, or warrior class, and the bow saw even  greater use as a weapon of war as the samurai struggled to establish themselves as a powerful new social class.

The Feudal Period

In 1192 Minamoto no Yoritomo was granted the title of shogun, or military governor, and established stricter standards for his warriors. As part of that training, Ogasawara Nagakiyo, the founder of Ogasawara  Ryu, was instructed to teach mounted archery in a more formal manner. It was during this time that the kyujutsu ryu, the schools of archery technique, came into their own. One of the most influential archers of  the time was Heki Danjo Masatsugu, the founder of Heki Ryu, who lived from 1443 to 1502. He is credited with standardizing the training of kyujutsu which no doubt assured its continued growth and development, even into modern times. It was during the Feudal period that the construction of the Japanese bow reached its peak. By the late sixteenth century it was regarded as being near perfect in design. So much so, that the bamboo and wood laminate bows used in modern kyudo are nearly identical to those made four hundred years ago. As it turned out, the end of the sixteenth century also spelled the end of the bow's usefulness as a weapon of war when Oda Nobunaga, commanding conscripts armed with muskets, defeated the opposing force of kyujutsu archers in a major battle in 1575.

The Transitional Period

In the seventeenth century Japan's period of civil war ceased and the emphasis of Japanese archery gradually changed from kyujutsu to kyudo, or, in other words, from the technique of fighting with a bow to the way of personal development. The Transitional period also saw the general public become more involved with the practice of archery. As the twentieth century dawned, Honda Toshizane, a kyudo instructor at Tokyo Imperial University, combined elements of the warrior and ceremonial styles to create a hybrid form that came to be known as Honda Ryu. Although the traditional schools were against the creation of this hybrid form, Honda Toshizane is widely credited today with ensuring the survival of kyudo in the twentieth century.

The Modern Period

In the early 1930's it became evident that modern kyudo would need to be standardized in some way to guarantee its continued growth. The issue was hotly debated and the agreement that was reached in 1934 was tentative at best. After World War II, the practice of kyudo, along with all other martial arts, was banned by the occupation forces. It wasn't until 1949 that final authorization was granted and the Zen Nihon Kyudo  Renmei (known as the All Nippon Kyudo Federation in English) was formed. In 1953 the kyudo kyohon (manual) was published, establishing the shooting procedures that are in common use today.

4 Principles Of Chado
Chado ( The way of Tea) is a Japanese cultural practice involving the preparation and serving of Matcha to a guest, primarily influenced by the Zen Buddhism and it is based around 4 core principles: Harmony, Respect, Purity and Tranquility ( Wa, Kei, Sei and Jaku). By practicing Chado, the aim is to experience and integrate these principles into one's daily life.

Wa (和) or “harmony” embodies the feeling of oneness with nature and people. It is expressed through a positive interaction between host and guest, guest and guest, and more in general between man and nature. It extends outside of the tea room through a way of living that is free from desire to impress, compete and dominate, enabling a merging and transcending of individual egos and roles.

Kei (敬) or "respect" is the ability to understand and accept others, even in those situations when one does not agree with another. By being kind and humble towards others we give respect and encourage others to do the same. Respect is also extended towards utensils and objects, as a result not only of the human effort invested to produce them, but also to the simple fact that they came to existence through Nature.

Sei (清) or “purity” refers to the ceremonial purity of the setting and utensils but, most importantly, to the ability to treat oneself and others with a pure and open heart.

This purity is not one of absolute cleanliness but one of pure intention. From the moment of intention-setting, through the process of purification and cleaning of the environment, up to the enjoying and admiration of one's effort, one's heart and soul are also being purified.

Jaku (寂) or "tranquility", the fourth principle, is not really a goal for which to strive but a natural result of following the first three principles of harmony, respect and purity. 

This tranquility is not to be confused with a sort of dreamy psychological state. Instead it represents the dynamic force of one’s innermost being that, stemming from the heart-felt realisation of the uniqueness of each moment, embraces and infuses the practice of Tea by giving significance to it.

Experiencing the four principles in the mundane act of preparing and drinking tea can extend to all that one does. Through the practice of Chado, one attempts to immerse themselves in a series of movements of serving tea, learning to appreciate each moment and carefully finishing what they are doing instead of hurrying on. The ultimate aim of Chado is to develop the ability to experience a deep sense of satisfaction and appreciation through the simple act of drinking tea.

By developing and practising this ability through tea we may also find ourselves extending this feeling of satisfaction and appreciation towards a lot of other daily activities, and perhaps even towards our relationships.

Unlock A Deadly Soul with Samurai Training
Your sword is an extension of your soul

"Engage in combat fully determined to die and you will be alive; wish to survive in the battle and you will surely meet death." — Uesugi Kenshin, 17th century samurai.

The samurai were the embodiment of the warrior's soul.

Whether it was their renowned discipline, devotion to their lord, or seeking an honourable death on the field of battle, the samurai dominated Japan for centuries as the elite class that are still revered to this day. Not all were great fighters either—some were master poets, scholars, or administrators.

But whether it's in films (The Last Samurai, Sanjuro), in manga (Vegabond, Lone Wolf and Cub), or even in the modern-day Samurai schools, the warrior soul of the samurai—some of history's greatest fighters — lives on.

But how exactly did samurai train? And what can we, simple modern day ashagaru, learn from their immense skill?

From cultivating an unshakeable discipline to seeing the sword as an extension of one's soul, let's look at the samurai in you.

Let's unsheathe our katana. Let's train.

A Little History: How did Samurai Train? As Disciples
"The samurai were the legendary warriors of old Japan who led noble and violent lives governed by the demands of honour, personal integrity and loyalty" — Professor Stephen Turnbull, The Samurai.

Samurai ("those who serve") emerged in the 8th century, only coming to an end in the 1870s when the class was outlawed. As the elite class in society, they dominated not only culture and politics, but perhaps most notoriously its military and fighting prowess. Their lives were busy — Yamamoto Tsunetomo, in his 1710 book Hagakure, noted that Samurai should rise at 4am (modern day samurai, take note), bathe and arrange his hair daily, eat when the sun comes up and retire when it's dark. Over the centuries no known codified training manual developed, with almost as many ways of training as there were individual samurai, but some commonalities exist than we can consider here now.

Physical training broadly reflected what many to come to think of in the samurai. Samurai trained young and throughout their lives. Though some increasingly shirked their physical training following the long peace of the 18th and 19th centuries, many trained daily, often testing themselves against the elements.

We know that samurai were trained in a variety of weapons, including the fabled katana, but also the bow and naginata (a sort of spear, especially used by women). Indeed, some women trained, though mostly to defend the home as opposed to dying in battle. Beyond this, samurai often pitted themselves against the elements (the wind, rain, and trekking the mountains) and performed synchronised movements that have since spawned modern variants today, such as Karate's kata.

Spiritual training is perhaps the most unique aspect of samurai training. Bushido, the 'Way of the Warrior', emerged as the de facto ethical code in which a samurai was expected to live — and die — by.

Loyalty to one's daimyo, or lord (the famous 47 Rōnin, made famous to western audiences thanks to Keanu Reeves), respect and compassion to all, as well as unshakeable discipline all featured in the samurai's way of life. Honour was expected: Seppuku, or self-disembowelment, emerged as a way to have control over one's death, and to hold onto one's honor should you fail on the battlefield. Samurai life was brutal in this mentality, and consequently many samurai lived as though they might die at any moment, a sort of 'Carpe Diem'.

Whether through physical or spiritual training, however, a samurai was ultimately a disciple, the "one who serves". This servitude, taken to its extreme, meant that samurai were unshakable in their pursuit of their moral code, even if it meant an early death.

They lived, in a sense, like the bloom of a cherry blossom—short yet intensely.

How to Train as a Samurai
While not everything can (or should!) be replicated (seeking death in battle) in the samurai training program, there are a few things that the modern samurai can learn.

1/ Develop Your Own Code
"Only when you live desperately can you shine the light of life"—Oda Nobunaga, 17th century samurai.

Samurai were often great fighters, known for their discipline and their loyalty towards their lords. They were rigid in their pursuit of perfection—whatever the samurai pursued they did so with 100% focus. Guiding a samurai was the Bushido, a moral code still influential in today's Japan, that samurai were supposed to abide by.

Through these rules, including living by honor, being courteous, and a martial spirit, samurai developed an intense approach to life that many strived to live day by day until their very last breath.

What can we learn from this?

Develop your own code.

From the 10 commandments to Bushido's Way of the Warrior, many find greatness in following a code for life. It gives us structure, a clear path in this complex world.

Perhaps more than ever, in this hectic modern life where everything feels chaotic, having life simplified to a few honorable rules can help place us in this world and give us meaning.

2/ Meditation and Mindfulness

"Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world" — Miyamoto Musashi, 17th century samurai.

Beyond a moral code, samurai also often pursued mindfulness and meditation. They sought to clear their mind and free themselves of stress before battle. They often engaged in refined arts, such as poetry and the infamous Japanese Tea Ceremony. A slow, complicated ritual, the samurai used the ceremony as a means to practice what we now know as mindfulness. Influenced by Zen Buddhism and later Confucianism, samurai often followed self-imposed minimalism, and believed that salvation comes from within.

Most incredibly, an old master of mine once regaled a story about a man who spent the bombing of Nagasaki meditating under a bridge. While the world around him was cast in hell he chose to be at peace.

And what can we learn from this?

Practice meditation and mindfulness. In this fast-paced world it's important to embrace slowness, to appreciate the smaller things in life. Meditation, as is well known, helps to alleviate stress and improves focus. Take up the daily habit, just 10 minutes a day to contemplate an open flame, the blossom on a tree, the swash and backwash of the untamed water and see the difference.

3/ Samurai Conditioning
"Have you ever thought of quitting?" — Interviewer.

"No, never. When I started on this path, I decided to do it till I died"—Kuwami Masakumo, modern day samurai.

Samurai embarked on their path for life. And they trained hard. Standing nude in the snow, or sitting beneath ice cold waterfalls, or even depriving themselves of food, water, or sleep, the pushed their limits.

Many also drank heavily, seen to encourage endurance and vigour.

Samurai also trained with weapons, in armour, or even unarmed combat (later spawning karate, judo, and aikido). Rarely used since samurai were nearly always armed, 'kata', or movement sequences, were instead used to condition the body and act as a moving meditation.

What can we learn from this?

Train in the elements. Embrace the outdoors, walk and climb and hike mountains, bathe in freezing cold water. In short—toughen your body to resist discomfort.

You also get to drink a lot, although that one is up to you…

4/ The Sword Is an Extension of Our Soul
"The sword has to be more than a simple weapon; it has to be an answer to life's questions"—Miyamoto Musashi, 17th century samurai.

A man's honor resides in his sword.

A samurai's sword is his soul, and as such it is treated with the utmost care and consideration. It is with the samurai at all times, even in the streets. It is wiped clean after drawing an enemy's blood. It is an extension of his very body, and treated as such.

What can we learn from this?

Know your equipment.

When you pick up a bar or a dumbbell, when you put those gloves on or your belt on, when you pick up your racket or your bat, you treat whatever equipment you have with the utmost respect. It is not external to you; it is part of you.

Remind yourself of this before you lift, or swing, or strike. Now answer me this: how hard did you just train?

Cultivate Your Soul and Live Life Like You Would Die Tomorrow
"What is the way of the samurai, and why is it so important to you?"— Interviewer.

"The way of the samurai is to kill people and to show how ugly humans can be…All of the wisdom and knowledge which was left for us by past samurai is fading away in modern times. It's a sign of peace."—Kuwami Masakumo, modern day samurai.

The famous Japanese swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi, undefeated across 60 duels, was both a warrior and a poet. He lived life as we might expect the idealised warrior to—lived as if he might die at any moment.

But the samurai were not perfect warriors.

Most notably, in their fighting they often lacked hand-to-hand training like wrestling, simply because they were almost always armed and had no need for it. But more than this, the way of the samurai is a brutal way of life— perhaps too much for us to bear. Samurai were, after all, a product of war and faded away with it. Japan's continued obsession — even their romanticization — of the samurai ethic is believed, after all, to be a contributing factor in the crippling fatigue and stress of so many in Japan today. Working yourself to death, or karoshi, is sometimes viewed as "company employee seppuku."

And yet there perhaps remains a beauty, some lesson in the way of the samurai. Lessons, I believe, we can become stronger by learning today.

So, what can we — as modern, comfortable homo sapiens — learn?

Develop your code.
Practice a daily meditation. Strive for mindfulness and minimalism.
Train in nature. Train when tired, hungry, or thirsty. Climb a mountain.
Know your equipment—become one with your training tools and your environment.
And, perhaps the most important lesson I've taken away from them, as Miyamoto Musashi attests to, is the spiritual development emphasised by the samurai. Bushido outlined an ideal, a moral code by which they should abide by. Its stance on death also, in a way, freed them from any anxiety: a samurai lived every day like his last. And that last note seems a worthy lesson to take to heart.

Here's to the soul of the samurai.
